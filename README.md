Learn SwiftUI with me!

I will be adding Sample Project folders in this Repository as I try to navigate my way with SwiftUI. I've learned SwiftUI around November of 2020 and I am still learning a lot of things about SwiftUI.

Here are the list of sample projects:
1. SwiftUIToggle
Creating a toggle is very easy especially if the state of your toggle is just in your View. But what if you need to show a list of Toggles wherein its initial values are not in your View but in a persistence store, like UserDefaults?
I had a hard time figuring out how can I show the initial value of my toggles from UserDefaults, and how do I update the UserDefaults value based on the Binding of these toggles?
Lastly, I have learned about AppStorage, which is a property wrapper for reading values from UserDefaults. Check this project to see different ways to work with Toggles.
